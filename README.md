# 005_ExpenseTracker



My project’s name is EXPENSE TRACKER, my name is Héctor Ortega, I am from Guayaquil - Ecuador.

My application allows the user to store the information about incomes and expenses of every day that he wants.
There is two type of users. A normal user can see a menu of statistics that show graphics, the first one shows the total of incomes and expenses, the other graphics show information grouped by type and day.

The transaction menu allows the user to create, update, edit and delete his income or expenses.

When an administrator user login in the systems he can make CRUD operations over entities like the identification type, user, transaction types, and of course this type of user can access the statistics and transactions menu like a normal user.

Now in the login page, there is an option that allows new users to make a registration. This registration form like all the options in the systems has validations of the data entered.

That's all I hope you like my project.
